# Feature Parity Checklist — branch `Rebuild`

Run the full list at every phase boundary. A phase is not done until every line passes.
"Pass" = behaves identically to v1.11.3 (`ce4c73c`) from the user's perspective.

## Core lifecycle
- [ ] Extension loads with zero console errors (fresh page load)
- [ ] Master enable/disable toggle works mid-session (UI appears/disappears cleanly)
- [ ] Settings persist across page reload (every section)
- [ ] v24 settings from live install load without reset; old keys migrate
      (`rpg-companion-sillytavern`, `dooms-character-tracker`)
- [ ] Per-chat data (`chat_metadata.dooms_tracker`) restores on chat switch
- [ ] Loading intro plays (film-credits / typewriter / off)
- [ ] i18n: switch en → ru → zh-tw → en; all visible labels update
- [ ] System Log and Notification Log capture entries; Copy All works

## Generation & tracking
- [ ] Tracker JSON injected on generation; fields parse into panels

## Chat Bubbles
- [ ] Discord style and Card style both render

- [ ] Bubble TTS buttons work

## Thoughts
- [ ] Thoughts panel renders per character; cards flip

## Weather & ambience
- [ ] Rain / snow / mist / clear(sun+dust) effects render for matching scene weather
- [ ] Indoor scenes suppress outdoor particles
- [ ] Effects pause when tab hidden; respect prefers-reduced-motion

## Feature toggle cycling (added requirement from rebuild)
For EACH feature: disable mid-session → no DOM residue, no console errors;
re-enable → feature fully functional without page reload; repeat twice
(catches double-binding).
